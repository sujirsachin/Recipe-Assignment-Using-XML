<Ingredients>1 medium jalapeno pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced</Ingredients>

</Procedure>
<Procedure>Step2: You can make the slaw 1-2 hours ahead of time and keep it cold in the fridge and then, when you are ready to eat, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and place the boneless, skinless salmon fillets into a oiled baking dish and brush the those with a good layer of the hoisin and place the dish on the center rack of the preheated oven. 
</Procedure>
<Procedure>Step3: Depending on the thickness of the salmon it could take 10-12 minutes to bake and, once the fish is cooked to your liking, it's time to eat.
</Procedure>
<Tip> Hint: You can make the slaw 1-2 hours ahead of time, and keep it cold in the fridge, to allow the flavors to develop. Add 1/4-inch water to the baking pan with the fish before baking to help keep any hoisin sauce from burning in the baking dish. </Tip>
